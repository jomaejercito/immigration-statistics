# Refugee Statistics
Welcome to the Refugee Statistics Project! This is a project I have made in collaboration with my mentor, product architect Or Pardo. We worked on this together with Agile workflow.

This project shows facts about the refugee crisis, terminologies, and worldwide statistics. This project was built with HTML/CSS, Ruby, and Rails backend. The CSS layout I used is called "thecharity", which I downloaded from colorlib.

Hope you enjoy this project!
