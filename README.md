# Refugee Statistics
Welcome to the Refugee Statistics Project! This is a project I have made in collaboration with my mentor, product architect Or Pardo. We worked on this together with Agile workflow.

This project shows facts about the refugee crisis, terminologies, and worldwide statistics. This project was built with HTML/CSS and Ruby on Rails. The CSS layout I used is called "thecharity", which I downloaded from colorlib. I implemented charts in this project from FusionCharts. The charts are animated and can also be clicked on.

Hope you enjoy this project!
